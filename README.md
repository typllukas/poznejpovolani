Project Overview: Educational Webinar Management System

This project is an advanced, multi-component application designed to streamline the management of educational webinars for "PoznejPovolani, z. s.," a non-profit organization focused on enhancing the educational experience of students through interactive webinars, see www.poznejpovolani.cz. Leveraging a sophisticated multicontainer Docker setup, the application seamlessly integrates with the Zoom API for efficient webinar scheduling and management.

Technical Features:

Docker-Based Architecture: The application uses Docker to facilitate a multi-container environment, segregating responsibilities between handling Zoom authentication and managing webinar functionalities.

Symfony Backbone: The system utilizes the Symfony framework to manage the core functionalities, including dynamic forms, complex entity relationships, and the automation of webinar management tasks.

Zoom API Integration: A dedicated Symfony service, ZoomTokenService, ensures efficient interaction with Zoom's API, central to automating webinar generation.

Key Technical Highlights:

Entity Relations Management: Demonstrates the management of intricate many-to-many relationships, especially within the webinar entity, facilitated by Doctrine ORM.

Form Complexity Management: Implements advanced form handling within Symfony, supporting complex data structures and interactions, such as dynamic sub-forms for detailed webinar setup.

Data Management: Incorporates Symfony commands for automated operations like importing registrant details from CSV, showcasing the application's efficiency in handling data.

Container Communication: Through Docker configuration, the system ensures seamless communication between Symfony and Redis containers, exemplifying effective inter-container communication.

Deployment and Application:
The system is actively used by "PoznejPovolani, z. s.," to automate the process of educational webinar creation, showcasing its effectiveness in meeting the organization's operational needs. The application creates a foundation that can be further developed towards functionalities such as generating customized reports, statistics, email capabilities, etc.

Conclusion:
The Educational Webinar Management System stands as a testament to the application of modern development practices and technologies in solving real-world problems. Its design not only streamlines the process of webinar management but also exemplifies the practical application of Docker, Symfony, and API integration in creating efficient and scalable solutions for educational purposes.
